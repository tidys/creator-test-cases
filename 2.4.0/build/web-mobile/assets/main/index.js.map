`话说天下大势，分久必合，合久必分。周末七国分争，并入于秦。及秦灭之后，楚、汉分争，又并入于汉。汉朝自高祖斩白蛇而起义，一统天下。后来光武中兴，传至献帝，遂分为三国。推其致乱之由，殆始于桓、灵二帝。桓帝禁锢善类，崇信宦官。及桓帝崩，灵帝即位，大将军窦武、太傅陈蕃，共相辅佐。时有宦官曹节等弄权，窦武、陈蕃谋诛之，作事不密，反为所害。中涓自此愈横。\r\n\r\n        建宁二年四月望日，帝御温德殿。方升座，殿角狂风骤起，只见一条大青蛇，从梁上飞将下来，蟠于椅上。帝惊倒，左右急救入宫，百官俱奔避。须臾，蛇不见了。忽然大雷大雨，加以冰雹，落到半夜方止，坏却房屋无数。建宁四年二月，洛阳地震；又海水泛溢，沿海居民，尽被大浪卷入海中。光和元年，雌鸡化雄。六月朔，黑气十余丈，飞入温德殿中。秋七月，有虹现于玉堂；五原山岸，尽皆崩裂。种种不祥，非止一端。帝下诏问群臣以灾异之由，议郎蔡邕上疏，以为霓堕鸡化，乃妇寺干政之所致，言颇切直。帝览奏叹息，因起更衣。曹节在后窃视，悉宣告左右；遂以他事陷邕于罪，放归田里。后张让、赵忠、封谞、段圭、曹节、侯览、蹇硕、程旷、夏恽、郭胜十人朋比为奸，号为“十常侍”。帝尊信张让，呼为“阿父”，朝政日非，以致天下人心思乱，盗贼蜂起。\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n

“甲子”二字于家中大门上。青、幽、徐、冀、荆、扬、兖、豫八州之人，家家侍奉大贤良师张角名字。角遣其党马元义，暗赍金帛，结交中涓封谞，以为内应。角与二弟商议曰：“至难得者，民心也。今民心已顺，若不乘势取天下，诚为可惜。”遂一面私造黄旗，约期举事；一面使弟子唐州，驰书报封谞。唐州乃径赴省中告变。帝召大将军何进调兵擒马元义，斩之；次收封谞等一干人下狱。张角闻知事露，星夜举兵，自称“天公将军”，张宝称“地公将军”，张梁称“人公将军”；申言于众曰：“今汉运将终，大圣人出。汝等皆宜顺天从正，以乐太平。”四方百姓，裹黄巾从张角反者四五十万。贼势浩大，官军望风而靡。何进奏帝火速降诏，令各处备御，讨贼立功；一面遣中郎将卢植、皇甫嵩、朱隽，各引精兵，分三路讨之。\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        且说张角一军，前犯幽州界分。幽州太守刘焉，乃江夏竟陵人氏，汉鲁恭王之后也；当时闻得贼兵将至，召校尉邹靖计议。靖曰：“贼兵众，我兵寡，明公宜作速招军应敌。”刘焉然其说，随即出榜招募义兵。榜文行到涿县，引出涿县中一个英雄。那人不甚好读书；性宽和，寡言语，喜怒不形于色；素有大志，专好结交天下豪杰；生得身长七尺五寸，两耳垂肩，双手过膝，目能自顾其耳，面如冠玉，唇若涂脂；中山靖王刘胜之后，汉景帝阁下玄孙；姓刘，名备，字玄德。昔刘胜之子刘贞，汉武时封涿鹿亭侯，后坐酎金失侯，因此遗这一支在涿县。玄德祖刘雄，父刘弘。弘曾举孝廉，亦尝作吏，早丧。玄德幼孤，事母至孝；家贫，贩屦织席为业。家住本县楼桑村。其家之东南，有一大桑树，高五丈余，遥望之，童童如车盖。相者云：“此家必出贵人。”玄德幼时，与乡中小儿戏于树下，曰：“我为天子，当乘此车盖。”叔父刘元起奇其言，曰：“此儿非常人也！”因见玄德家贫，常资给之。年十五岁，母使游学，尝师事郑玄、卢植；与公孙瓒等为友。及刘焉发榜招军时，玄德年已二十八岁矣。\r\n        \r\n        当日见了榜文，慨然长叹。随后一人厉声言曰：“大丈夫不与国家出力，何故长叹？”玄德回视其人，身长八尺，豹头环眼，燕颔虎须，声若巨雷，势如奔马。玄德见其形貌异常，问其姓名。其人曰：“某姓张，名飞，字翼德。世居涿郡，颇有庄田，卖酒屠猪，专好结交天下豪杰。适才见公看榜而叹，故此相问。”玄德曰：“我本汉室宗亲，姓刘，名备。今闻黄巾倡乱，有志欲破贼安民，恨力不能，故长叹耳。”飞曰：“吾颇有资财，当招募乡勇，与公同举大事，如何？”玄德甚喜，遂与同入村店中饮酒。正饮间，见一大汉，推着一辆车子，到店门首歇了；入店坐下，便唤酒保：“快斟酒来吃，我待赶入城去投军。”玄德看其人，身长九尺，髯长二尺；面如重枣，唇若涂脂；丹凤眼，卧蚕眉；相貌堂堂，威风凛凛。玄德就邀他同坐，叩其姓名。其人曰：“吾姓关，名羽，字寿长，后改云长，河东解良人也。因本处势豪，倚势凌人，被吾杀了；逃难江湖，五六年矣。今闻此处招军破贼，特来应募。”玄德遂以己志告之。云长大喜，同到张飞庄上，共议大事。\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        飞曰：“吾庄后有一桃园，花开正盛；明日当于园中祭告天地，我三人结为兄弟，协力同心，然后可图大事。”玄德、云长齐声应曰：“如此甚好。”次日，于桃园中，备下乌牛白马祭礼等项，三人焚香，再拜而说誓曰：“念刘备、关羽、张飞，虽然异姓，既结为兄弟，则同心协力，救困扶危；上报国家，下安黎庶；不求同年同月同日生，但愿同年同月同日死。皇天后土，实鉴此心。背义忘恩，天人共戮。”誓毕，拜玄德为兄，关羽次之，张飞为弟。祭罢天地，复宰牛设酒，聚乡中勇士，得三百余人，就桃园中痛饮一醉。来日收拾军器，但恨无马匹可乘。正思虑间，人报有两个客人，引一伙伴当，赶一群马，投庄上来。玄德曰：“此天佑我也！”三人出庄迎接。原来二客乃中山大商：一名张世平，一名苏双，每年往北贩马，近因寇发而回。玄德请二人到庄，置酒款待，诉说欲讨贼安民之意。二客大喜，愿将良马五十匹相送；又赠金银五百两，镔铁一千斤，以资器用。玄德谢别二客，便命良匠打造双股剑。云长造青龙偃月刀，又名冷艳锯，重八十二斤。张飞造丈八点钢矛。各置全身铠甲。共聚乡勇五百余人，来见邹靖。邹靖引见太守刘焉。三人参见毕，各通姓名。玄德说起宗派，刘焉大喜，遂认玄德为侄。\r\n        \r\n        不数日，人报黄巾贼将程远志统兵五万来犯涿郡。刘焉令邹靖引玄德等三人，统兵五百，前去破敌。玄德等欣然领军前进，直至大兴山下，与贼相见。贼众皆披发，以黄巾抹额。当下两军相对，玄德出马，左有云长，右有翼德；扬鞭大骂：“反国逆贼，何不早降！”程远志大怒，遣副将邓茂出战。张飞挺丈八蛇矛直出，手起处，刺入邓茂心窝，翻身落马。程远志见折了邓茂，拍马舞刀，直取张飞。云长舞动大刀，纵马飞迎。程远志见了，早吃一惊；措手不及，被云长刀起处，挥为两段。后人有诗，赞二人曰：\r\n        \r\n        英雄露颖在今朝，一试矛兮一试刀。初出便将威力展，三分好把姓名标。\r\n        \r\n        众贼见程远志被斩，皆倒戈而走。玄德挥军追赶，投降者不计其数，大胜而回。刘焉亲自迎接，赏劳军士。次日，接得青州太守龚景牒文，言黄巾贼围城将陷，乞赐救援。刘焉与玄德商议。玄德曰：“备愿往救之。”刘焉令邹靖将兵五千，同玄德、关、张，投青州来。贼众见救军至，分兵混战。玄德兵寡不胜，退三十里下寨。玄德谓关、张曰：“贼众我寡，必出奇兵，方可取胜。”乃分关公引一千军伏山左，张飞引一千军伏山右，鸣金为号，齐出接应。次日，玄德与邹靖，引军鼓噪而进。贼众迎战，玄德引军便退。贼众乘势追赶，方过山岭，玄德军中一齐鸣金，左右两军齐出，玄德麾军回身复杀。三路夹攻，贼众大溃。直赶至青州城下，太守龚景亦率民兵出城助战。贼势大败，剿戮极多，遂解青州之围。后人有诗赞玄德曰：\r\n        \r\n        运筹决算有神功，二虎还须逊一龙。初出便能垂伟绩，自应分鼎在孤穷。\r\n        \r\n        龚景犒军毕，邹靖欲回，玄德曰：“近闻中郎将卢植与贼首张角战于广宗，备昔曾师事卢植，欲往助之。”于是邹靖引军自回，玄德与关、张引本部五百人投广宗来。至卢植军中，入帐施礼，具道来意。卢植大喜，留在帐前听调。\r\n        \r\n        时张角贼众十五万，植兵五万，相拒于广宗，未见胜负。植谓玄德曰：“我今围贼在此，贼弟张梁、张宝，在颍川与皇甫嵩、朱隽对垒。汝可引本部人马，我更助汝一千官军，前去颍川打探消息，约期剿捕。”玄德领命，引军星夜投颍川来。时皇甫嵩、朱隽领军拒贼，贼战不利，退入长社，依草结营。嵩与隽计曰：“贼依草结营，当用火攻之。”遂令军士，每人束草一把，暗地埋伏。其夜大风忽起。二更以后，一齐纵火，嵩与隽各引兵攻战，贼寨火焰张天。贼众惊慌，马不及鞍，人不及甲，四散奔走。\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        杀到天明，张梁、张宝引败残军士，夺路而走。忽见一彪军马，尽打红旗，当头来到，截住去路。为首闪出一将，身长七尺，细眼长须；官拜骑都尉；沛国谯郡人也；姓曹，名操，字孟德。操父曹嵩，本姓夏侯氏；因为中常侍曹腾之养子，故冒姓曹。曹嵩生操，小字阿瞒，一名吉利。操幼时，好游猎，喜歌舞；有权谋，多机变。操有叔父，见操游荡无度，尝怒之，言于曹嵩。嵩责操，操忽心生一计：见叔父来，诈倒于地，作中风之状。叔父惊告嵩，嵩急视之，操故无恙。嵩曰：“叔言汝中风，今已愈乎？”操曰：“儿自来无此病；因失爱于叔父，故见罔耳。”嵩信其言。后叔父但言操过，嵩并不听。因此，操得恣意放荡。时人有桥玄者，谓操曰：“天下将乱，非命世之才不能济。能安之者，其在君乎？”南阳何颙见操，言：“汉室将亡，安天下者，必此人也。”汝南许劭，有知人之名。操往见之，问曰：“我何如人？”劭不答。又问，劭曰：“子治世之能臣，乱世之奸雄也。”操闻言大喜。年二十，举孝廉，为郎，除洛阳北都尉。初到任，即设五色棒十余条于县之四门。有犯禁者，不避豪贵，皆责之。中常侍蹇硕之叔，提刀夜行，操巡夜拏住，就棒责之。由是，内外莫敢犯者，威名颇震。后为顿丘令。因黄巾起，拜为骑都尉，引马步军五千，前来颍川助战。正值张梁、张宝败走，曹操拦住，大杀一阵，斩首万余级，夺得旗幡、金鼓、马匹极多。张梁、张宝死战得脱。操见过皇甫嵩、朱隽，随即引兵追袭张梁张宝去了。\r\n        \r\n        却说玄德引关、张来颍川，听得喊杀之声，又望见火光烛天，急引兵来时，贼已败散。玄德见皇甫嵩、朱隽，具道卢植之意。嵩曰：“张梁、张宝势穷力乏，必投广宗，去依张角。玄德可即星夜往助。”玄德领命，遂引兵复回。到得半路，只见一簇军马，护送一辆槛车；车中之囚，乃卢植也。玄德大惊，滚鞍下马，问其缘故。植曰：“我围张角，将次可破；因角用妖术，未能即胜。朝廷差黄门左丰前来打探，问我索取贿赂。我答曰：‘军粮尚缺，安有余钱奉承天使？’左丰挟恨，回奏朝廷，说我高垒不战，惰慢军心；因此朝廷震怒，遣中郎将董卓来代将我兵，取我回京问罪。”张飞听罢，大怒，要斩护送军人，以救卢植。玄德急止之曰：“朝廷自有公论，汝岂可造次？”军士簇拥卢植去了。\r\n        \r\n        关公曰：“卢中郎已被逮，别人领兵，我等去无所依，不如且回涿郡。”玄德从其言，遂引军北行。行无二日，忽闻山后喊声大震。玄德引关、张纵马上高冈望之，见汉军大败，后面漫山塞野，黄巾盖地而来，旗上大书“天公将军”。玄德曰：“此张角也！可速战！”三人飞马引军而出。张角正杀败董卓，乘势赶来，忽遇三人冲杀；角军大乱，败走五十余里。三人救了董卓回寨。卓问三人现居何职。玄德曰：“白身。”卓甚轻之，不为礼。玄德出，张飞大怒曰：“我等亲赴血战，救了这厮，他却如此无礼；若不杀之，难消我气！”便要提刀入帐来杀董卓。\r\n        \r\n        正是：\r\n        \r\n        人情势利古犹今，谁识英雄是白身？安得快人如翼德，尽诛世上负心人！毕竟董卓性命如何，且听下文分解。`;\r\n        longtext = longtext.split(\"\\n\").map(x=>x.trim()).filter(x=>x.length > 0).map(x=>
